Download your Barnes & Noble wishlist and show price changes and any
discounted books.

Configuration is minimal. Create a file 'wishlist.config' in the current
directory with the following contents:

url="your wishlist url"

The wishlist url will look something like

https://www.barnesandnoble.com/account/wishlist.jsp?giftlistId=somenumbers&sort=-dateAdded&pp=100&p=1

Make sure that "pp" is enough to hold all the books in your wishlist. 100 works for me.

Run as

> bnwishlist

This will read the config file, complain inscrutably if anything is
wrong, retrieve the list from bn.com, and process it. The list will be
saved to 'wishlist.json'. The current list will be compared to the
contents of 'wishlist.json' and any price changes will be
reported. Then the full list of discounted books will be printed.
